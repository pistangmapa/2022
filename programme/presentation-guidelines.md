## Tracks

Talks can be classified as being Academic track or General track.

### Academic track

The Academic track includes original research contributions addressing any topic or domain connected to open data, open mapping, open geospatial, and their applications. All types of papers are welcome, such as on results achieved, case studies, work in progress, reviews and demos. Academic track presentations must show originality, novelty, and relevance in their field.

In selecting Academic track presentations, particular attention will be given to the reproducibility of the research and its adherance to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Researches that make all aspects (e.g. data, steps, methods, code) openly available and openly licensed, or those that use exisiting open data and methods, are preferred.

### General track

The General track includes all other presentations that are not part of the Academic track.

## Presentation types

There are two main presentation types:

### Talk (25 minutes)

Classic talk/presentation with 20 minutes for the talk itself and 5 minutes for questions.

### Lightning talk (5-10 minutes)

Lightning talks are short talks/presentations that last between 5 to 10 minutes only. Several lightning talks under the same topic/theme will be grouped together as one session with 10 minutes for questions after the session.

### Workshops (1hr, 2hr, 4hr)

Hands-on and skill-building sessions. Workshops are required to be held on-site.
