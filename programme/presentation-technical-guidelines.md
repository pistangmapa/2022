## Recording

In case you will not be able to join the Pista on-site, you may opt to give your presentation remotely via a pre-recorded video for the convenience of everyone, as well as avoid tech-related hiccups during the conference. The Q&A segment right after a session will be live, and your presence is expected.

Please keep in mind that the recorded videos are to be part of the conference sessions, hence the Pista ng Mapa 2022 [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference/code-of-conduct.html) applies. As a supplement to this, we have crafted session guidelines for a smoother and enjoyable session for all.

Presenters may opt to record their videos on their own or (if you haven’t created one yet or having difficulty) may schedule a recording session with our technical team. The recording session would use our conference platform and subsequently record your videos directly on Youtube.

## General Guidelines

- Please make sure you are in a well lit and echo free location.
- Always check your video and audio input devices.
- Plain solid background is preferred but not required.
- As a minimum your videos should include your presentation (via a slide deck or otherwise) and voice over, while video inset of your self is preferred but not required.
    - Tip: In case you have one. Looking straight at the camera will create a connection with participants; looking down at the notes will have the opposite effect.
- Please make sure to adhere to our time limits.
    - 5-10 minutes for a lightning talk.
    - 20 minutes for a regular talk.
- Our audience is diverse and English is not our first language. We request you to speak slowly, loudly and clearly.

## Online Recording Session (with us)

- Recording sessions will be done via Zoom and uploaded to an unlisted Youtube video.
- Before the recording session starts, please submit a copy of your slide deck so we can monitor your progress during the recording.
- While recording, our technical team would remind you of the time remaining on chat function. It maybe helpful to have a clock or timer nearby, to help you keep track of the time.
- Due to resource constraints we have to limit our recording to a maximum of three (3) takes.
- Editing would be limited to cutting (or splicing?) of a video take.
We’ll provide you with the unlisted Youtube link so you can view the recorded video.
- Unfortunately, no do overs. In case the final video is not to your liking, you could still send us a recording on of your own. (As long as it still within our submission deadlines.)
- If you are late by 15 minutes for your recording session with the tech team, without notifying us beforehand, we will assume that you’ve opted to cancel your session with us. 

## Recording on your own

- You may record your own video using a software of your choice (e.g. OBS, Zoom, etc.)
- Video format: MP4 preferred, 720p (1280×720) or 1080p (1920×1080) at 30-60fps
- Filename format: pnm22-[lastname]-[firstname]-[presentation-title].mp4
