    <h1>Be a Volunteer</h1>
    <p>
    There won't be a Pista ng Mapa without volunteers. Help organize the event, create publicity materials, handle the conference programme, get sponsorships, and share the Pista with friends. Everyone is welcome to volunteerâ€”all that's required is the willingness to help.
    <br>
    The Pista is a wonderful opportunity to reconnect with friends, meet new ones, and integrate with the open mapping community in the Philippines!
