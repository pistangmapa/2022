## How to get there

### Getting to SM Legazpi

You may take the airport van/ shuttle to downtown Legazpi. There’s no fixed schedule, the van leaves once full. 
Here’s the Legazpi airport van/ shuttle fare:


#### By Taxi
Alternatively, there are taxis at BIA. Fare will be based through Taxi Meter Charge only. Refuse “pakyawan rate” (charter rate without using the meter) to avoid overcharging. And tell the driver to drop you off at SM Legazpi.

### Getting to Bicol University College of Engineering from SM Legazpi

SM City Legazpi is the largest shopping mall in Legazpi. Beside SM Legazpi is the terminal. From there, you may ride a public transport (jeep or tricycle).

#### By Jeepney

Ride a jeepney to BUCENG. Tell the jeepney driver to stop by the DENR Building. In order to reach the BUCENG gymnasium, find the BUCIT road which is across the DENR Building. Carefully cross the road towards the tricycle terminal. You may walk there for 5-8 mins to the campus.

#### By Tricycle

If you’re in a hurry, you can catch a tricycle cab and ride your way to BUCENG gymnasium or anywhere in Legazpi. Price ranges from PHP 50 - 100 or USD $1-2.
