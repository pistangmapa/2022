<h1 class="color-primary-4 mb-2">Code of Conduct</h1>

## Summary

The organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any public space within the venue, including lectures, talks, or presentations.

## What is this CoC for?
This Code of Conduct ensures an effective exchange of ideas and information during the activity,  in an atmosphere free of abuse or harassment, and characterized by courtesy and respect. To that end, the organizers expects all individuals who attend to conduct themselves in a manner that establishes an atmosphere free from discriminatory practices.

In order to implement our Code of Conduct in the strictest manner possible, we work with institutions that believe, support, and uphold our values of providing our attendees and guests a safe and harassment-free environment to collaborate and build communities in. We work with partner institutions to make sure that help us enforce the Code of Conduct. While laws differ from nation to nation in guaranteeing constitutional rights for addressing harassment issues, we especially value the role played by our partner institutions in ensuring a safe and harassment-free environment.

## Who does this CoC apply to?
Every individual who is a part of this activity - the organisers, the attendees, the participants, and the support staff.

## What is harassment?

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Workshops, presentations and talks are also subjected to anti-harassment policy. In particular, the presenters should not use inappropriate content or images in their presentations and workshops.

## What are the consequences of violating the CoC?

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the activity with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns that you are unable to satisfactorily resolve amongst the person(s) involved, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Escalation to, and incident reporting by a small subset of conference team leaders will ensure that repeat offenders do not go unnoticed.

Support staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your presence.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

## Consequences

If we (in our sole discretion) determine that you are behaving in a manner that is—or could be—disruptive to the event or other attendees, violates our Code of Conduct, or is in violation of these terms, then we can refuse to admit you to or expel you from the event. If we do, you aren’t entitled to any form of refund or compensation. At our discretion, we may also ban you from future events for a definite or indefinite time period.
