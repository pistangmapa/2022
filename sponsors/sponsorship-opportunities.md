Sharing is the essence of Pista. With the valuable support of our sponsors and partners, we are able to organize a free and open conference that fosters the growth of local and inclusive communities for Filipino open data, open source, and open mapping advocates, enthusiasts, and professionals. 

## Conference profile

Pista ng Mapa  (Filipino for "Festival of Maps") is a not-for-profit outreach event to encourage public participation, promote the use of open (geo) data, free software (FOSS4G), and related technologies. It aims to gather together contributors, enthusiasts, and users in the public and private sector (community, government, academe, corporate, individuals, etc.), highlight achievements, and foster the growth of hyper-local communities outside the capital region.

### Rationale

The Philippines' capital region, Metro Manila, is host to numerous geo/map-py related events throughout the year but the rest of the country rarely hosts any, except for the occasional seminar or workshop intended for small, targeted groups through project-based initiatives of various organizations.

### Past Pistas

##### PnM19

In 2019 August, the inaugural Pista ng Mapa (aka PnM19) was held in Dumaguete City in Central Visayas, with Foundation University as venue sponsor, that attracted 166 participants from various parts of the country.

##### PnM20

PnM goes online! 

We initially hoped that this event was to be held in Cebu City in 2020 but due to the COVID-19 pandemic,  a lot of face-to-face events were canceled due the lockdowns and strict policies imposed by the Philippine government for safety. Not to be deterred, PnM pushed through with its first online conference. 

We organized 3 whole-day events in November 2020 using Jitsi as our video-conference and Youtube platform to engage more than 150 participants coming from different cities and provinces like Metro Manila, Batangas, Bicol Region, Davao, Cebu, Surigao, and more! 

The online conference was recorded and can still be watched today on Youtube. 

### PnM21

Last year, we had ~200 participants with the same loving-kindness and energy that made PnM19 and PnM20 a huge success. We hope to reach out to more people, and organizations who want to invest in and leverage the power of diverse peoples in participatory activities for greater access to Free and Open (geo) data in this 2022 installment of PnM.

### Expected Results

For our supporters, we hope that through this event, they can reaffirm themselves as a champion and community pillar for bringing open (geo)data and free software to the local community of enthusiasts, users, and field practitioners. That through our collaboration, it could lead to more novel applications, and a wider understanding of how spatial data is relevant to other academic fields of study, outside the domain of “maps” and “technology.”

We strive to spark the interest of new users, reignite the passion of current contributors, and help nascent local communities grow, where skills and local expertise can be developed or further enhanced.
